# Housing prices in King County in 2018

This project offers an updated estimate of the number of Opportunity Youth in South King County using the 2017 5-year American Community Survey [(ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html) Public Use Microdata Survey [(PUMS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/pums.html).

## Findings

Many factors influence the saleprice of homes. According to expert opinions (cited below), specifically square footage, porches, and waterfront property increases a home's saleprice. 

From our model, we have determined that several factors increase the salesprice of a home.

    1. Square foot of total living
    2. Waterfront footage
    3. Traffic noise
    4. Full baths
    5. Additional cost
    6. Sewer system
    7. Inadequate parking 
    8. Age of house
    9. Porch
    10. Waterfront location


### The higher square footage increases home sale price.
We determined that the square footage of a home is directly correlated with the sale price. From our model, each square foot in the house increases the saleprice by $375

### Having a porch increase home sale price.
Our model predicts that having a porch increases saleprice by $36,000.

### Having a beachfront or lakefront increase home sale price.
It depends where the home is located. A home by Lake Sammamish can sell for an additional $3.5 million while a home by the Puget Sound has a decreased value and is predicted to sell for $47,000 less.



## Methodology

* Download data from the [King County House Sales dataset](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx).The tables required for this analysis are:
    + Real Property Sales
    + Residential Building
    + Parcel
* Create housing_prices [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/) ;
* Query residential house data with SQL;
* Using python to execute sql and export [residential house csv file](/data/processed/residential_prices.csv).

* Using python to build a linear regression model with a target variable of home sale price with our note and data visualization. 
    + To deal with categorical variables, use OneHotEncoder in [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    + To build a linear regression model, use [statsmodels](https://pypi.org/project/statsmodels/)
    + To visualize descriptive statistics, use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) 

## Process
* Use POSTGRES SQL engine to query residential house price
 + Sale Price more than 0
 + Principal Use is residential
 + ZipCode is not null
 
* Use OneHotEncoder to encode categorical features as a one-hot numeric array;
* Observe sale price distribution and drop the unreasonable sale price data(less than 50,000 USD);
* Check 3 claims about housing prices 
1. Higher square footage increases home sale price<sup>1, 2</sup>
2. Having a porch increases home sale price<sup>3, 4</sup>
3. Having a beachfront or lakefront increases home sale price<sup>5</sup>

* Adding more features to the model and check there is no high correlation between features. The features in our model:
    1. Square foot of total living
    2. Waterfront footage
    3. Traffic noise
    4. Full baths
    5. Additional cost
    6. Sewer system
    7. Inadequate parking 
    8. Age of house
    9. Porch
    10. Waterfront location
* Visualize error distribution of the model, predicted sale price distribution, predicted and actual sale price distribution
