RE: Housing Saleprice Claims

Many factors influence the sale price of homes. According to expert opinions (cited below), specifically square footage, porches, and waterfront property increases a home's sale price are three factors that can optimize the sale price. 

We modeled the sale price of a house by using 13 predictors on ~5200 sales records from the King County Department of Assessments. We used the following predictors:
Square foot of total living
- Waterfront footage
- Traffic noise
- Full baths
- Additional cost
- Sewer system
- Inadequate parking 
- Age of house
- Porch
- Waterfront location (4 locations)


Questions we can address with our model: 

<b>Does higher square footage increases home sale price?</b>

Yes, we determined that the square footage of a home is directly correlated with the sale price. From our model, each square foot in the house increases the sale price by $375

<b>Does having a porch increase home sale price?</b>

Our model does not show that having a porch is statistically significant.

<b>Does having a beachfront or lakefront increase home sale price?</b>

It depends where the home is located. A home by Lake Sammamish can sell for an additional  $3.5 million while a home by the Puget Sound is not statistically significant in our model.


While these three questions are interesting, we would like to have more conclusions from our model. To do this we want to: 
- investigate the data and search for more unreasonable outliers,
- add more predictive features, like location to a school system, to our model, 
- investigate if one predictor, the age of the house, is dependent on other features, and
- consider the economy in 2018 and compare the results obtained with another year.
